ABSTRACT 
This study presents the development of an Internet of Things technology based for inventory 
management for the Dome Branch of Vanessa Derrick Logistics (VDL) Fulfilment. The branch 
uses traditional  stock counting to  manage inventory which  result in frequent inaccuracies, 
operational delays and a lack of reliable data on stock. The research employed a system 
development and descriptive research methodology to identify current operational challenges and 
create an Internet of Things system tailored to the company's situation. Data were gathered from 
warehouse employees and administrators through interviews, questionnaires, observations, and 
detailed requirements analysis. The  new system incorporates Radio Frequency Identification 
technology, various sensors, and a real time monitoring dashboard to automate stock detection. 
Key capabilities of the system include automatic item identification, instant inventory updates, low 
stock notifications, anomaly alerts, and improved item picking routes. The Technology 
Acceptance Model (TAM) is used to evaluate user acceptance and the system’s usability by 
assessing its perceived usefulness and ease of use.

CHAPTER ONE 
1.0 Introduction 
1.1 Background 
In today’s global marketplace, inventory management has become a vital backbone of every 
organization. It involves the process of tracking, controlling, and monitoring goods from 
procurement to final sale. According to Atnafu (2018), inventory management systems ensure that 
the right quantity of items is available at the right time, minimizing waste, cost, and delays. 
Globally, industries have realized that poor inventory management causes stock outs, 
overstocking, and customer dissatisfaction (Mashayekhy, 2022). 
Production management module of the system can manage product categories of system 
production; Warehouse management (Huynh et al., 2014) includes inventory management and out 
of storage management functi on, the former monitoring products in stock information, the latter 
shipment handling according to processed orders. Internet of Things allows organizations to track 
stock levels in real -time, monitor environmental conditions, and predict demand with high 
accuracy (Ugbebor, 2024). Based on the data about the inventory quantity and location, machine 
learning, a component of IoT-based inventory management solution architecture (Lin, 2012; Gubbi 
et al., 2013), can forecast the number of raw materials needed for the upcoming production cycle. 
 However, inventory  systems are not without challenges. The good side includes real -time 
visibility, faster delivery, and better decision -making (Kawa, 2021), while the bad  side involves 
high setup cost, network reliability issues, and a shortage of technical skills (Mashayekhy, 2022) 
From a global perspective, large economies such as the USA, China, and Germany are already 
implementing smart inventory systems integrated with robotics and cloud computing. In Africa, 
several countries like Kenya, South Africa, and Nigeria are experimenting with Internet of Things 

--- PAGE 7 ---

adoption in logistics and warehouse management, although challenges such as poor infrastructure 
and internet connectivity persist (Ugbebor, 2024). In Ghana, most firms still rely on manual or 
semi-automated systems, which limit e fficiency and transparency. Studies reveal that poor 
inventory management practices contribute to loss of revenue, delays in order fulfilment, and 
reduced customer satisfaction (Opoku et al., 2021). 
Therefore, designing and implementing a smart inventory management system leveraging Internet 
of Things is crucial for Ghanaian firms especially VANESSA DERRICK LOGISTICS Fulfilment. 
 
1.2 Problem Statement 
Inventory management is a critical function in every organization, as it ensures that the right 
quantity of products is available to meet customer demand while minimizing waste and costs.  
Traditional inventory systems often rely on manual data entry and periodic stock counts, which 
are prone to human error and delay  (Mashayekhy, 2022 ). While these systems can h elp track 
goods, they fail to provide real -time updates, resulting in poor decision -making, financial losses, 
and reduced customer satisfaction. An analysis of issues involved in assessing inventory 
management systems reveals that inventory management ofte n holds a process, planning, 
information and organizational dimension (Corbey and Jansen, 1993; Alfaro and Tribo, 2003; 
Abdul-Jalbar et al., 2003; Lutz et al., 2003). Internet of Things devices can automatically sense, 
track, and report inventory movement,  enabling real -time visibility and automation (Ugbebor, 
2024).  
In Africa these challenges are even more pronounced. Most organizations continue to use semi -
automated or paper-based inventory systems that make it difficult to synchronize stock information 
across suppliers and customers (Ugbebor, 2024). As a result, firms often experience late deliveries, 

--- PAGE 8 ---
3 
 
inaccurate records, and inefficiencies that reduces competitiveness in African supply chain (Opoku 
et al.,2021; Adjei & Mensah, 2022). 
In Ghana,= companies rely on manual spreadsheets or outdated software that cannot provide real-
time visibility into vendor stock levels. This gap makes it difficult to ensure efficient coordination 
between vendors, warehouses, and customers. 
To address this persistent gap, th is study proposes the design and implementation of a smart 
inventory management system leveraging Internet of Things technology, called “Inventory Eye”.  
 
1.3 Study Objective 
1.3.1 General Objective 
To design a smart inventory management system leveraging Internet of Things technology for 
VDL Fulfilment. 
1.3.2 Specific Objective 
Based on general objectives this study has four specific objectives 
a. To assess the current inventory management system of VDL Fulfilment to identity prospect 
and challenges of VDL Fulfilment’s existing inventory management system. 
 
b. To develop administrative policies and procedures that support the smooth integration of an 
Internet of Things based inventory system (Inventory Eye) into daily operations.

d. To test the performance and reliability of the “Inventory Eye” system in improving inventory 
management operations. 
 
1.4 Scope of the Project 
This study focuses on the design and implementation of a smart inventory management 
 system, known as Inventory Eye, which leverages Internet of Things technology to 
 enhance operational efficiency. The research will primarily cover both administrative and 
 technical aspects of inventory management. Administratively, the study will examine the existing 
inventory management practices, identify operational challenges, an d evaluate how smart 
technologies can improve efficiency, coordination, and decision-making. The focus will be on how 
management policies and  employee readiness influence the adoption and success of digital 
inventory systems. 
 The technical scope will cover system architecture design, 
software development, testing, and of performance in terms of speed, reliability,  
accuracy. 
Geographically, the study will be conducted in Ghana, focusing on VANESSA 
DERRICK LOGISTICS Fulfilment. The study will not cover the entire supply chain but will limit 
itself to inventory monitoring, vendor coordination, and order fulfilment processes. The time scope 
will focus on system design and testing within a defined operational period. Internet of Things 
sensors like radio frequency identification systems, sensors for tracking items or product and quick 
response codes for real -time stock tracking, automated alerts, and a central database for 
synchronizing inventory information between vendors and logistics units. The technical scope will 
cover system architecture design, software development, testing, and of  performance in terms of 

--- PAGE 10 ---

speed, reliability, and accuracy. 
 
1.5 Significance of the Study (Non-IT and IT related) 
a. The study will help ensure that inventory recorded are accurate by minimizing the variation 
between the quantity of goods stored in the warehouse and the quantity of goods recorded in the 
system.   
b. The study will improve the efficiency of staff by reducing delays caused by tradi tional stock 
counting.  
c. The system will automatically monitor inventory as well as give update on stock levels with the 
use of Internet of Things (IoT) devices such as RFID tags and sensors.  
d. The system will provide a flexible technology base that the company can easily expand and add 
new feature to suit future technology initiatives. 
 
1.6 Limitations of the Project 
This study has drawbacks despite its significance. First and foremost, the use of Internet  
Things technology such as Radio Frequency identification tags, sensors, and network  
equipment may require capital for purchase, which could affect the full implementation of  
the system.  
Moreover, the system’s performance depends on a good internet connectivity. In areas  
with poor network, data will not be effectively generated 
In addition, the study will be limited by the technical skills of staffs.  Employees must  
acquire training before they can use the system comfortably. Finally, the study focuses  
mainly on a particular branch. This means that study is restricted to the Dome branch and

CHAPTER TWO 
LITERATURE REVIEW 
2.1 Introduction 
The integration of technology into inventory management has revolutionized operational 
efficiency in logistics and the IoT played a crucial raise in it.  This chapter is focused on the 
application of the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and other technology adoption theories 
to the Inventory Eye IoT -based system which aims to address continuous challenges within the 
Vanessa Derrick Logistics (VDL) Dome branch. 
 
2.2 Theoretical Review 
 The theoretical review outlines the core concepts that guides the design and implementation of a 
smart inventory management system for VDL. The key theory relevant to this theory is the 
Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). 
Technology Acceptance Model  
The Technology Acceptance Model, developed by Davis (1989), is one of the most widely used 
theories to explain how users accept and use new technologies. According to TAM, there are two 
main factors that determine user acceptance. Thus, Perceived Usefulness (PU), the degree to which 
a person believes that using a system will improve their job performance and Perceived Ease of 
Use (PEOU), the degree to which a person believes that using a system will be free of effort. In 
the context of this study, TAM helps to explain how administrators and warehouse staff are likely 
to adopt and use the Inventory Eye system. Consequently, the more employees realize that the 
system will make their task to easier to perform; the higher is the probabili ty that they will use it 
and accept the technology as being useful (Dillon & Morris, 1996). If it helps them monitor stock 

--- PAGE 13 ---
8 
 
in real time, reduces manual work and easy to operate, they are more likely to accept and 
continuously use it. Researchers such as (Venkatesh & Davis, 2000) & (Gefen, 2003) have shown 
that perceived usefulness strongly predicts technology adoption in organizational environments  
By applying this theory, this study ensures that the system design prioritizes user satisfaction, 
efficiency, and simplicity, making technology adoption smoother in a developing country context. 
Despite its frequent use, leading the original proposers to  attempt to redefine it several times. 
Criticisms of TAM as a “ theory” include its questionable estimation value, limited explanatory 
and predictive power, unimportant, and lack of any practical value.  
 
2.3 Review of Research Variables 
This chapter presents a comprehensive review of existing academic literature on inventory 
management practices, the integration o f Internet of Things (IoT) technologies in warehousing, 
and the application of intelligent systems within supply chain operations. It also explores the major 
theoretical frameworks that explain how organizations adopt, implement, and utilize technological 
innovations in Supply Chain Management (SCM). Together, these strands of literature form the 
foundation for understanding the relevance and potential impact of an IoT -based intelligent 
inventory management system. 
 
The review begins with traditional and contemporary inventory management approaches, 
examining how organizations maintain stock accuracy, minimize operational inefficiencies, and 
improve service delivery. It highlights common limitations of manual and pape r-based systems 
such as errors, delays, and limited visibility which are directly reflected in the operational 
workflow of the VDL Dome Branch. These limitations are seen in the branch’s dependence on 

--- PAGE 14 ---
9 
 
physical stock-taking, slow updates, and inconsistencie s between recorded and actual inventory 
levels. 
 
Next, the literature on IoT enabled warehousing is surveyed, emphasizing how technologies such 
as RFID tags, sensors, barcode automation, wireless networks, and cloud platforms transform 
inventory operations. Scholars consistently show that IoT improves real-time visibility, enhances 
tracking, reduces human error, and supports predictive decision -making. These benefits strongly 
align with the needs of the VDL Dome Branch, where the absence of real -time monito ring 
contributes to stock discrepancies, slow fulfilment cycles, and disrupt the flow of goods or services 
resulting in delays and inefficiencies  
 
The review also examines intelligent systems such as automated data analytics, machine learning, 
and smart dashboards which help organizations interpret warehouse data and optimize decisions. 
For a facility like the VDL Dome Branch, these technologies can provide timely alerts, automate 
routine tasks, and ensure accurate reporting, eventually strengthening the  branch’s fulfilment 
reliability. 
 
Finally, the chapter assesses technology adoption theories, including the Technology Acceptance 
Model (TAM), Diffusion of Innovation (DOI), and the Technology Organization Environment 
(TOE) framework. These theories help ex plain the factors influencing the willingness and 
readiness of an organization like the VDL Dome Branch to adopt an IoT -based solution. 
Understanding these factors such as perceived usefulness, organizational capacity, staff readiness, 
and environmental pressures helps identify potential barriers and enablers to implementation. 

--- PAGE 15 ---

Through this review, the chapter identifies a clear research gap: although IoT and intelligent 
systems have been widely studied globally, there is limited localized research on their application 
within medium-scale logistics facilities in Ghana, particularly in operational contexts similar to 
the VDL Dome Branch. Addressing this gap justifies the need for developing an IoT -based 
intelligent inventory management system tailored to the branch’s operational challenges. 
 
2.4 Contextual background of the study area  
 Vanessa Derrick Logistics (VDL) Fulfilment is a limited company founded in the year 2019 by 
Vanessa Omari. It has over 5 branches in Ghana and operates  as a m edium-scale logistics and 
warehousing facility serving customers in Ghana . The warehouse stores a diverse range of 
products including fast moving consumer goods and bulky goods  for both retail and wholesale 
shops. The 500 square meter warehouse has over 90  shelves and has the capacity to store over 
2000 goods. Current operations involve manual stock -taking and paper -based processes, which 
contribute to common challenges such as inaccurate stock records, slow fulfilment, and limited 
visibility of real -time i nventory status. Before  items are brought into the warehouse, vendors 
contact VDL through email or calls to verify whether there’s enough space for the storage of their 
products before they are sent in.  While items leaving the warehouse are delivered based  on a 
customer’s contact via email or call. As a result of the inaccuracy and manual stock-taking of 
records, VDL Fulfillment faces stockouts often and become slow during peak hours. Due to the 
increase of incoming goods, orders and handling of different varieties of goods, there is a need for 
a change in the operational structure of VDL  Fulfillment. The introduction of an inventory 
management system will be used to communicate with vendors and customers on incoming and 
outgoing products, take stock-counting and records of available products and delivered products.

2.5 Review of Existing Systems and Technologies 
These are some types of systems that businesses use to manage their stock: 
a. Manual Systems: Writing things down in books or using Ex cel and this actually slows down 
work. 
b. Barcode Systems: some businesses use barcodes to scan items. This is a cheaper way of 
managing stock 
c. RFID Systems: business use tags that can be read automatically without scanning one by one. 
This technology is fast and accurate, but it’s very expensive. 
d. Warehouse Management Systems (WMS): This is a big software tools like Odoo that help 
manage warehouse operations. 
 
2.6 Proposed System 
   The solution is to build a smart inventory system using Internet of Th ings (IoT) technology to     
help manage stock at Vanessa Derrick Logistics. 
Main things our system will do:  
a. Automatically detect items using RFID tags. 
b. The system will show a real-time information on a dashboard for staff and managers. 
c. ⁠The system will send alerts when stock is low, close to expiry, or if something unusual happens. 
d. ⁠Help staff pick items faster by suggesting the best route in the warehouse.

2.7 Chapter Summary 
This chapter reviewed relevant literature to designing an Internet of Things based technology for 
Inventory Management. The chapter relies on the Technology Acceptance Model, which explains 
how users adopt new technology based on perceived usefulness and ease of use. Technolog y 
Acceptance Model helped predict how Vanessa Derrick Logistics Fulfilment warehouse staff and 
managers would accept the proposed “Inventory Eye” system, especially if it is beneficial, easy to 
operate, and improves work efficiency. 
The review also examine d key research variables. Studies on inventory management shows the 
challenges of manual stock counting which include errors, delays, and stock inconsistencies at 
Vanessa Derrick Logistics Fulfilment Dome branch. It then explored Internet of Things 
technologies which include sensors, Radio Frequency Identification tags and wireless networks. 
These tools provide real time visibility, improve tracking accuracy, reduce manual work, and 
support predictive decision making. 
Intelligent systems like smart dashboar ds, automated analytics, and alert-based monitoring were 
discussed to show how they can enhance warehouse decision making and streamline operations. 
Such technologies are especially relevant for Vanessa Derrick Logistics Fulfilment Dome Branch, 
to manage stock accurately

CHAPTER THREE 
RESEARCH METHODOLODY 
3.1 INTRODUCTION 
This chapter describes the steps that need to be taken to develop and evaluate the "Inventory Eye" 
Intelligent Inventory Management System based on the Internet of Things (IoT) for Vanes sa 
Derrick Logistics (VDL) Fulfillment . The methodology describes the steps, instruments and 
methods used to make sure that the study  is carried out in a systematic manner, as well as 
consistent with the project’s aims.  In this  chapter, research design, po pulation and sampling 
techniques, data collection processes and the system development methodology are described. It 
also offers a crystallized understanding in the operation of VDL Fulfillment, which form the 
foundation for defining the system requirement s and design architecture . The combination of  
qualitative inquiry with an Agile software development methodology,  is intended to create a 
comprehensive investigation of the organizational challenge as well technological innovation that 
is being developed to solve the problem. 
 
3.2 Research Design 
The study will adopt a Qualitative Research Approach, A qualitative approach is chosen because 
the core objective is to gain an in -depth understanding and rich description of a specific, 
contemporary phenomenon (the business need/problem) within its real -life context (Yin, 2018). 
Unlike quantitative research, which focuses on statistical generalization, this approach prioritizes 
the contextual depth necessary to formulate actionable and tailored business solutions. The 
research design that will be adopted in the study is interview. Interview will help us gather in depth 
information about inventory management at Vanessa Derrick Logistics, Fulfilment. Information 

--- PAGE 19 ---
14 
 
will include the company's specific inventory practice and workflow, user experience, current 
problems faced by the company, challenges relating to potential implementation of the study. 
 
3.3 Population  
The target population is defined as the complete group of individuals, objects or events that share 
a common characteristic, which the researcher aims to study and analyze in order to draw 
conclusions (Jilcha Sileyew, 2020; Garg, 2016).  
Due to its size, it employs between 75 and 100 people in a variety of roles. Twenty employees will 
be the study's target population because of their roles in VDL. 
 
3.4 Sample and Sampling Techniques 
A purposive sampling technique will be employed to select participants. This non-probability 
sampling method allows the researcher to deliberately choose individuals who possess 
specialized knowledge or experience concerning the study topic (Creswell & Poth, 2018). 
The sample size will consist of approximately participants, distributed as follows: 20 
CEO 1 
IT OFFICER 1 
LOGISTICS OFFICER1 
INVENTORY SUPERVISOR 1  
INVENTORY ASSOCIATE  3 

--- PAGE 20 ---
15 
 
VENDOR RELATIONS OFFICER 1 
CUSTOMER SERVICE OFFICER 2 
ACCOUNTS OFFICER 1 
RIDERS  4 
DRIVERS  4 
Purposive sampling is suitable because not every employee is directly involved in inventory 
management or Internet of Things technology integration. Selecting only those with relevant 
roles ensures the quality and reliability of responses. 
 
3.5 Data Collection and Instruments 
The study will employ both primary and secondary data collection instruments

3.7 Crystallization of the Problem 
The inventory management sector faces significant challenges, particularly for VANESSA 
DERRICK LOGISTICS Fulfilment, a medium -scale logistics provider in Ghana. Traditional 
inventory management systems have proven inadequate in addressing the complexities of modern 
supply chains, and this crys tallization identifies key issues that impact inventory management at 
VDL Fulfilment. 
Key Issues Identified 
Three main challenges stand out. First, the reliance on traditional inventory management processes 
leads to inefficiencies. VDL Fulfilment's depende nce on manual stock counts and data entry not 
only consumes time but also increases the likelihood of human error, thereby hindering real -time 
tracking and decision-making. 
Secondly, there are frequent discrepancies between actual stock levels and recorded data, resulting 
in inaccurate stock records. This inconsistency can lead to problems such as stock outs or 
overstocking, which ultimately affect operational efficiency and customer satisfaction. 

--- PAGE 24 ---
19 
 
Finally, a lack of real -time visibility exacerbates these ch allenges. Without immediate access to 
inventory updates, the logistical team struggles to respond effectively to customer demands, 
leading to delays in order fulfillment and a decline in service quality. 
Proposed Solutions 
To address these challenges, two pivotal solutions have been proposed. The first is the 
implementation of the "Inventory Eye" system, which leverages Internet of Things (IoT) 
technologies like RFID tags and sensors. This system would automate stock monitoring and 
provide real-time updates on inventory levels and locations, thereby eliminating discrepancies and 
improving accuracy. 
The second solution focuses on enhancing workforce readiness through training and support. By 
equipping staff with the necessary skills to effectively use the new  system, VDL Fulfilment can 
ensure a smoother transition and better integration of the technology, ultimately leading to 
improved operational efficiency and customer satisfaction. 
By tackling these key issues with targeted solutions, VANESSA DERRICK LOGIST ICS 
Fulfilment has the opportunity to transform its inventory management practices and enhance its 
overall performance in the competitive logistics landscape. 
 
3.8 Requirements of the Proposed System  
The "Inventory Eye" system is designed to address the inventory management challenges faced by 
VANESSA DERRICK LOGISTICS Fulfilment. Below are the key requirements categorized into 
functional, technical, and operational aspects.  

--- PAGE 25 ---
20 
 
Functional Requirements 
a. Real-Time Inventory Tracking 
o Utilize IoT technologies (e.g., RFID tags and sensors) to automatically detect and 
update item quantities and locations in the warehouse. 
b. Automated Alerts 
o Generate notifications for low stock levels, items approaching expiration, and any 
unusual inventory movements. 
c. User Dashboard 
o Provide a centralized dashboard that displays real -time inventory data, analytics, 
and operational insights to staff and management. 
d. Inventory History Logs 
o Maintain detailed logs of all inventory movements, including additions, removals, 
and adjustments, allowing for auditing and analysis. 
e. Vendor Coordination

3.9 Design of the System 
The "Inventory Eye" system is designed to modernize inventory management for VANESSA 
DERRICK LOGISTICS Fulfilment. Wi th a web -based architecture using React Native for the 
front end and Node.js for the back end, the platform ensures a user -friendly experience for staff 
and administrators. The system consists of modular components to facilitate efficient inventory 
tracking, management, and reporting. 
3.9.1 System Architecture 
The proposed platform follows a three-tier architecture structure: 
a. Presentation Layer (Front-End) 
o User Interface (UI):  Interactive dashboards for both inventory staff and 
administrators. 
o Inventory Overview Pages: Displays current stock levels, locations, and alerts. 
o Order Management Pages: Allows for tracking and managing orders. 
o Login and Registration Forms: Secure access for staff and admin roles. 
o Technologies Used:  Built using React Native for cr oss-platform compatibility, 
ensuring a seamless experience on both web and mobile devices. 
b. Application Layer (Back-End) 
o Authentication Logic: Manages login and access controls. 
o Inventory Management Logic:  Handles inventory updates, alerts, and tracking 
processes. 
o Order Processing Logic: Manages the flow of orders from initiation to fulfillment.

o Analytics and Reporting: Provides insights on inventory levels and user activities. 
o Technologies Used:  Developed using Node.js, utilizing Express as the web 
framework for efficient server-side logic and API management. 
c.  Data Layer (Database) 
o User Accounts: Stores login credentials and role-based access information. 
o Inventory Data: Stores details of items, quantities, locations, and status. 
o Order Records: Maintains logs of orders placed and their status. 
o Analytical Data: Stores analytics for user activity and inventory performance. 
o Database Implementation: Utilized MongoDB for flexible data storage, enabling 
easy access and manipulation of JSON-like data structures. 
3.9.2 System Modules 
a. User Authentication Module 
o Allows both staff and administrators to register, log in, and securely access the 
system. 
b. Dashboard Module 
o Displays vital information including:  
▪ Current inventory levels 
▪ Alerts for low stock and expiration 
▪ Notifications for orders and issues 
c. Inventory Management Module

3.9.3 Data Flow Summary 
A simplified flow of how data moves within the system: 
a. User logs into the system → System checks credentials against the database. 
b. User accesses dashboard → Inventory data is retrieved from the database. 
c. User adds or updates inventory → The system saves changes and alerts are generated 
if necessary. 
d. User processes an order  → Order details are stored in the database and notifications 
are sent. 
e. Admin updates inventory data → Changes reflect immediately across the platform for 
all users. 
f. User provides feedback → Feedback is captured and stored for future improvement.
